      <h3>Description</h3>
              <p> This fast, easy, and delicious no bake strawberry cheese cake will have you making 3 at a time! Cheesecakes can be modified in many ways to fit whatever you're in the mood for!
            My personal favorite is strawberries and I use them frozen and thaw them a half hour before I make the cheesecake. Blueberries, rasberries, peaches, and vanilla all work splendidly!
            Toppings alone are so fun to play with. You can add Oreo crumbs, sliced fruit, or chocolate shavings. I recommend adding blueberries and sliced strawberries to the top of this recipe! </p>
